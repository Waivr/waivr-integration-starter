# Waivr

There a set of examples to illustrate integration with Waivr's API (https://docs.waivr.co). 

The following folders in this repo are simplified suggestions for a quick start.

## Integration Considerations
Waivr is an API solution, that means that your API Access Token is every sensitive and should never be shared with others.

For the examples on this repo, you will see the API Access Token openly usage; However, we strong recommend that you store it below an authorized layer.
That means environment variables, Backend systems, encrypt/decrypt vaults or other safe solution.
